I always feel like my selection in GSoC 2013 was all magic because of the fact that I was
completely unaware about the presence of infosec community in GSoC. I contacted
[**Abraham Aranguren**](http://blog.7-a.org), the project leader for **OWASP Offensive Web Testing Framework**.
He was very helpful throughout the gruelsome process of making a proposal. Thanks to him,
the proposal turned out to be like [**this**](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/tunnelshade/5785905063264256).
My proposal got selected and my mentor advised me to do some pre-implementation research
so that I face less problems in the future.

My pre-implementaion research is present [**here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_iaOYaiSya83uxiecYhCJYBwQPubCWs463DJebNOqcQ/).
So based on the results I started implementing my GSoC project. After implementation, I did 
some benchmarks which are available [**here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TdV667Uh3Fq272Wl8upzWi3c45-8E1tTVLcYPmc6yPM/)

Finally, I successfully completed my GSoC 2013 project. Some points to keep in mind :

- Start early so that you get good amount of time to fine tune your proposal.
- Get your proposal reviewed by someone, a different perspective always helps.
- Try to do some research and include those results in your proposal.
- **Contribute to the project beforehand (atleast an issue fix)**. This will attest your skill with the project.
- Code happily and receive a nice paycheck :).

**NOTE: GSoC 2013 has been a boon for me as I met people whom I would have missed probably.
GSoC will give you a great open-source project to contribute**
