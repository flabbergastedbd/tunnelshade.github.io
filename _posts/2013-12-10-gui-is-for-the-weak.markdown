Recently there has been lot of fuzz about the **end of winamp** and **video tearing **in **vlc in awesome wm **etc... As this is my own blog, I am going to state some of my opinions :P  

- **GUI is for the weak**

The above statement may seem highly arrogant and misleading, but hold on for a second. Let me elaborate :-  

If you are a serious geek and resource freak, you should start shifting 
to command line interfaces and utilities, especially if you are using a 
tiling window manager like **awesome**. Command line utilities increase
your productivity while at the same time reduce your resource usage.  

My multimedia needs are satisifed by two superb utilities:-  

- **CMUS** - Music Player ( [Website](http://cmus.sourceforge.net/), [man cmus](http://linux.die.net/man/1/cmus), [3rd party docs](http://www.tuxarena.com/static/cmus_guide.php))
- **MPlayer** - Video Player ( [Website](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/%E2%80%8E), [docs](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/index.html) ) 

Screenshot of my desktop when I use these utilities :-
