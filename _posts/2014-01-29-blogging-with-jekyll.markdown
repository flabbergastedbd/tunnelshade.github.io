I never really considered shifting my blog to a different platform as I am lazy and
my previous attempts ended up wasting my time. But then I got bored of using
blogger interface to write posts. Apart from the fact that you don't have to take care of
hosting, everything else in Blogger is a disaster for me.

+ Ugly themes
+ Bad editor
+ Ugly themes :P
+ Bad editor XD

So I thought of shifting to some other solution. My decision parameters were:-

+ I want free and reliable hosting for the blog because I dont want to run around fixing stuff.
+ I should be able to write posts in markdown.
+ I want to theme my blog ground up.

Jekyll is something which is suitable for me:-

+ Github pages can be used for hosting.
+ Redcarpet markdown.
+ Nice templating engine.

How I got this blog running?

+ Install **Jekyll** in your system & don't forget to add **~/.gem/ruby/.../bin** to your **PATH** variable

```
gem install jekyll
```

+ Visit [jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) on how to use jekyll
+ Checkout [github pages](http://pages.github.com) on hosting your new jekyll blog
+ Also visit [this](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles) to use custom domain etc..
