After a long time I had some quality time to try a tiling window manager. My first tiling window manager is **AWESOME**. Some important things to remember while going out on this path :-
  
- It can be really tough in the beginning to **write/tweak** configuration files, but it will be worth the sweat :P
- Read the **awesome &amp; arch wiki** carefully. I found all the solutions to my problems in those well crafted & to-the-point articles.
- Take the help of smartest buddy - **Google**
- **Don't back out**.

**Dont forget to save those config files somewhere, because you will put considerable amount of effort into those.
