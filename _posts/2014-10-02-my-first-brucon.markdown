**It couldn't have been any better for me**. If you haven't been to BruCON, I suggest you to hurry up. As one of the attendees
tweeted - '*You never meet a stranger at BruCON*'. I was one of the [**5by5** speakers](http://2014.brucon.org/index.php/Schedule)
for the 2014 edition.

#### Travel

The journey was too long with a flight time of 11 hours. My journey was **VNS-DEL-AUH-BRU**. I reached Brussels on 24<sup>th</sup> Sept.
All my weariness vanished the moment I landed in *Brussels Airport*. Since it was my first time in Europe, I had the privilege to
admire almost everything :P. Adding to this, **Gent** was nothing short of a visual treat.

#### Day 0 (24<sup>th</sup> Sept, 2014)

As soon as I reached my hotel, I contacted my team mate who was already there. At the speakers dinner, I met my GSoC 13 mentor
[**Krzysztof Kotowicz**](https://twitter.com/kkotowicz) along with many other cool people and came to know about their work. That
night was a blast, and as soon as I returned to the hotel, I dozed off.

#### Day 1 (25<sup>th</sup> Sept, 2014)

The first day at conference involves registration. As soon as I checked the [schedule](http://sched.brucon.org), I realised that the
[lightning talks](http://2014.brucon.org/index.php/Lightning_Talks) were scheduled in the afternoon of the same day. So, sitting in a
talk, finished the slides and mailed them. It wasn't particularly great, but it went on something like this

What followed it was a huge surprise

#### Day 2 (26<sup>th</sup> Sept, 2014)

The second day, I met my other GSoC 2013 mentor [**Javier Marcos**](https://twitter.com/javutin) and saw him win the **nviso** ctf.
In the afternoon I had the 5by5 talk, which went like this

The slides are available on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/tunnelshade/brucon-2014-5by5-owasp-owtf). Met few more cool people.
Overall, it was a really good experience. On my flight back home, all I did was to correct people who used a wrong twitter handle :P.
If you wish to see some pics, I have them in my fb albums.
